# Bikesharing

# Purpose

To analyze bike sharing data from NYC for a proposal in Des Moines. We used python to transform the data Tableau to visualize. At the end of this read me is a link to the Tableau story.

# Results

The total number of rides was 2,344,224. 

The majority of rides identified as male, males also rode the bikes for longer periods than females and people's whos gender was unidentified.

People born in 1969 were the highest number of riders but when you subscription type was taken into account it showed that they were not the higehst number of subscribers. People born in 1990 were the highest.

Overall this could be a success in Des Moines, the correct demgraphic has to be reached and there has to be an adequete number of younger rides as they are the ones most likely to subscribe for longer. Riders that are older may just try the bike share once and then drop it. We need consistent users and the data shows that the 1990's are the group to reach.
